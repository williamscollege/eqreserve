Monthly Calendar

The monthly calendar displays the equipment reservations in a calendar format.
Allows user to navigate from month to month to see reservations.
Displays reservations for each in time order.
Can see a daily display if any day is clicked.

========================================================================================================================

The main building of the monthly calendar is within calendar_util.php using the main function draw_MonthlyCalendar.
The functions renderMonthHeader and renderCalendarCells are used as helper methods.
    - draw_MonthlyCalendar:
        + Required parameters: current month and year and all the schedules for the requested equipment group.
    - renderMonthHeader:
        + Required parameters: current month and year
    - renderCalendarCells:
        + Required parameters: current month and year and all the schedules for the requested equipment group

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First the table is started in the main draw_MonthlyCalendar function.

Call renderMonthHeader: draw the top part of the calendar (the navigation arrows, the month, and year)

    - Takes $month (format: '2'), and converts it to actual month name (format: 'February').
    - Create $header with previous and next month navigation and current month and year, embedding AJAX data for calling previous and next months.
        + data-yearnum = current year aka $year (format: '2015')
        + data-prev = tells calendar to decrease month (format if fetched: '-1')
        + data-next = tells calendar to increase month (format if fetched: '1')
        + data-monthnum = current month aka $month (format: '2')
    - Returns $header

Call renderCalendarCells: draw the cells and the items that are booked on that day.

    - Use $running_day (keeps track of the weekly days) to fill in the blank days so that the current month displayed starts numbering on the correct day.
    - Fill in all the dates for the days of the month by keeping track of the current day being drawn ($list_day) and making sure that it is less than
      $days_in_month (total number of days in the $month (format: '2') in the specified $year (format: '2015')).
        - For each day, if there is a corresponding time block (found by using $schedule) on that day, month, and year, present it.
        - Take account of repeating reservations by comparing start and end times of time blocks and then use the reservation names to display.
    - If reach end of a week (aka 7 days), wrap around.
    - Do this until the $list_day is equal to the $days_in_month.
    - If need be, fill in blank days.
    - Returns $cells

Returns the concatenated calendar.
