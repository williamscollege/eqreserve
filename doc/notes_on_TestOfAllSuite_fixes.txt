1. fclose() error
    Had to enable apache, specifically on a Mac, to be used for MAMP.
    Enabled using command sudo apachectl -start in terminal.

2. Errors regarding port
    Error with IndexPageLoadTest.php
    localhost/eqreserve was not being recognized. It had to be fixed to be localhost:8888/eqreserve.
    Recursively replaced all of these instances in the files to be port :8888 instead of port :80 by creating
    LOCAL_WEBSERVER_PORT_SPEC defined as :8888 in institution.cfg.php.
    After that, rather than localhost:8888/eqreserve/index.php, was being redirected to localhost/eqreserve/index.php
    and thus was getting 404 error. Inserted :8888 for APP_FOLDER path in institution.cfg.php file.

    Error in /tests/web_page_tests/SchedulesCreateTest.php
    Insertion of LOCAL_WEBSERVER_PORT_SPEC variable in $urlbase not allowed ("expression not allowed as default field value")
    resulting in a 500 error so manually inserted localhost:8888 into $urlbase.

3. Header modification error
    PHP error messages similar to : "Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
    (output started at /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/eqreserve/head.php:77) in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/eqreserve/util.php on line 46"

    Made a TestOfNarrowSuite.php to check for specific errors. Tested one file at a time rather than all at once.

    Split into head_pre_output.php and head_output.php. Problem was being redirected at points while data was being outputted.
    Thus split head.php so that head_pre_output.php has the necessary functions to run basically for set up and then
    head_output.php starts the output. This way, redirects do not have to both with interfering with header output.
    Refactored head.php to be head_pre_output.php and added head_output.php to files that required head_pre_output.php
    (made use of grep command in terminal). Place head_output.php after any redirects.

4. Database errors
    Several errors connected to AjaxUserAndGroupSearchTest.php (specifically testSearchUserAndGroupAccess)
    related to database and SQL. Expected 10 test users but returned 11 because testing user that we have used to sign in
    also has the string "test" in it. Changed to check the testing user for the string and if the testing user contains
    "test" then expect 11 users.
