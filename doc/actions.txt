Equipment Reserve Actions

A list of actions that the people using the system can take, and the role(s) necessary to take each action.

GENERAL DESIGN/IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: 
    all data manipulation actions should be implemented as ajax calls when possible, 
    but navigation uses full page reloads

    notes: the UI for this is the same as consumer reservation, but there's a checkbox to make it a manager reservation; ALSO, the back-end implementation is the same, except- conflicts do not cause an abort, over-rides of non-manager reservations send an alert to the person that made the other reservation, and the other reservation is removed/deleted

        current user has consumer role for the group (direct or indirect)
        this group has a scheduling rule
    notes: there's a complex interplay between choosing items and choosing times- as items are chosen, various times become unavailable, and as times are chosen various items become unavailable. Try to make UI handle this in a flexible manner...

[NOT SURE HOW / IF TO HANDLE THIS... certainly easier to have user just delete and re-create
[    - also relatively simple to allow reductive edits (remove items, shrink times)
[    - adding items is tricky
[    - altering times (extending and/or shifting) is tricky
